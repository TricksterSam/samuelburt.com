      <div class="section-title"> <a name="playing">Playing a Daxophone</a>
      </div>
      <p>
        Daxophones sing, squawk, squeel, chirrup, grunt, growl, and cackle. Their fluid approach to pitch is similar to that of a theremin or bowed saw. The wood adds natural resonances that mimic the human voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical performance involves clamping a long piece of wood to the body then bowing the wood. This is no simple task. The daxophone virtuosi have mastered delicate variations in bow pressure and placement. They must also take care of the placement of the dax, a heavy teardrop-shaped piece of wood that stops the vibration at select points along the length of the wooden tongue. In combination, these manipulations allow a performance that is akin to playing a modular synthesizer or chains of guitar pedals, with complex, unpredictable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body is just an amplification surface with a piezo microphone element inside. Other small objects can be placed atop and amplified.
      </p>
      <p>
            <a name="equipment"><img src="images/playing_demonstration.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto" alt="Pictographic demonstration of how to assemble and play a daxophone. See description above." /></a>
      </p>
      <div class="large-text" >
        Equipment</div>
      <p>
      <p>
        In order to play the daxophone, you will need a bow. German bass bows work great. You'll also need an amp. Acoustic guitar amps sound fantastic, but any powered speaker will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you plan to plug into a mixer, consider going through a Direct Input box, because the daxophone's piezo has a really high electrical impedance. You might also consider a piezo preamplifier, although this isn't strickly necessary to get a desirable sound. A volume pedal is useful not only to bring down the level when its too strong but to also silence the daxophone while swapping out tongues. A tasteful level on a reverberation pedal can give the daxophone a little more sustain while a well-chosen compressor pedal can help control some of the strong spikes of direct signal that the daxophone can generate in some circumstances.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;" >
        The daxophone can sound a bit like an <i>ondes Martenot</i>. I've constructed a <i>diffuseur m√©tallique</i> from a speaker cabinet, an amplifier, an audio transducer, and a gong. I've also got parts to build a <i>palme diffuseur</i>. Playing the daxophone through non-traditional speakers can result in new, delightful resonances.
      </p>

      <a name="tongues"><img src="images/tongues2.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto" alt="Picture of eight daxophone tongues, flat pieces of wood about 33cm long of various shapes and colors" /></a>
      </p>
      <div class="large-text" >
        Tongues</div>
      <p>
      The tongue is the core of the daxophone's sound. Each tongue is differentiated by size, shape, wood type, and grain structures. Few tongues provide a reliable two octave playing range. Fewer still, three octaves. Many have wolf tones or yodel points. </p>
      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
      When constucting a tongue, consider hard wood with tight grains, about 33 centimeters in length and about 5 millimeters thick. Thinner will result in floppier tongues with low, even subaudible frequencies. Tongues thicker than 6 millimeters will be highly resistant to sounding. Focus particularly on the top edge, where you will bow. Holes will interrupt the continuity of pitch across a tongue, but will also create vocal resonances like "WOW", "YOW", and "WHY". Experimentation is the key to learning! Do the opposite of what I've suggested here!
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
            <img src="images/desk_badger.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto" alt="Picture of Desk Badger. The top part of the image shows the Desk Badger in playing position. The second image flips it over to show the bottom. The daxophone features a wood piece on the left that clamps to a table. On the right is a body with a quarter-inch jack and a flat top. The first piece acts as a clamp for the second and they are connected with a big wooden knob on a bolt. The bottom of the daxophone has a whole cut where the quarter-inch jack is embedded and a oval hole providing access to two piezo elements attached to the top plate." />
      </p>




      <p>
        In 2011, I discovered Hans Reichel's wood cut plans and instruction manual. I began building daxophones adapted from his specifications. Anyone with a small amount of woodworking skill and the desire should build a daxophone. It's the most wonderful thing you can do with a piezo contact mic!
      </p>
      <p>
          Reichel's original design simply clamped onto the side of a table. He encountered performance experiences that involved comically large tables in proportion to his tiny instrument. He evolved the daxophone to stand on its own, with three legs. In the process, he worked out a 45 degree playing angle, which allows better control over bowing and manipulating the dax along the top edge of a tongue. Unfortunately, the stability of this instrument depends on long legs that don't pack and travel well.
      </p>
      <p>

        With the need for a smaller instrument that can fit in a suitcase, I designed the Desk Badger. It's great for clamping next to your modular synthesizer or on the desk of your home studio. The daxophone has returned to the table now with the convenient 45 degree playing angle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pictured is my most recent design. I've left the internals exposed so one can fix solder connections or experiment with placement of the piezo elements which are secured with blue plasti-tak.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        Reichel didn't want people to feel constrained by his ideas. He believed that if others experiented, they would discover other ways to make daxophones and tongues. I encourage others to do so, but if you must purchase a daxophone from someone, I build them, one at a time with love. See the bottom of this page for purchasing details. I've posted a copy of Reichel's plans <a href="http://samuelburt.com/daxophones/DaxInfo.pdf.zip"> here for anyone looking for a starting place</a>. I'm happy to provide advice, too. Get in touch!

      <a name="open_body"><img src="images/open_body.jpg" alt="Picture of table clamp daxophone. The top part of the image shows a daxophone in the playing position. The left part of the daxophone is cut to the shape of a thin flat piece of wood that is 45-degrees off axis. The body features a clamp piece consisting of a rectangle on top connecting through the body via a bolt to a wooden knob on the bottom. The bottom part of the image reveals that the daxophone was constructed by attaching two side panels to the block on the back where the clamp goes through. A quarter-inch jack is embedded in one of the side panels. It is connected to a piezo element that is attached to the underside of the flat top plate." /></a>

      <p >
        This was my first design for a table clamp daxophone. They are easier to construct and use less wood than the Desk Badger. The latter is hewn from a solid block. The former is more easily built using two side panels.
      </p>
      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        I'm looking at plans to build a daxophone with Eurorack CV and ENV outputs. This open body plan could accommodate a circuit board.

        <a name="bandsaw"><img src="images/band_saw.jpg" alt="The back side of this daxophone clamps to a table and is clearly an unfinished 2x4.

      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        This is a very simple daxophone design that anyone could make with a bandsaw. To simply even further, one could substitute the wooden clamp for a C-clamp.
      </p>

      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        Styrofoam also makes a great acoustic resonator. Clamping tongues to a large cooler like those seafood restaurants use both recycles the styrofoam into something useful and provides ampflication without the need for electricity!

        Cutting Board Daxophone
      </div>

      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        Daxophones can take many shapes. The basic requirements are a clamp and a surface that provides amplification to the wooden tongues. Pictured is a design inspired by Daniel Fishkin's Starship Daxophones. Instead of clamping the body to a table or standing it on legs, you sit on a flat paddle while the body extends outward on a hinged arm.

      <p style="padding-bottom:30px;">
        For years I worked with Hans Reichel's design, eventually adding threading to the legs to improve stabilization. This form requires the most precision and care of construction.

        Samuel Burt built his first daxophone in 2011 consulting with and using the <a href="http://samuelburt.com/daxophones/DaxInfo.pdf.zip">plans</a> of inventor <a href="http://daxo.de">Hans Reichel</a> who first recorded his instrument in 1987.
      </p>
      <p>
        The daxophone is based on the principle of bowing tongues of wood.  The daxophone clamps the tongue on a sound board amplified with piezo elements on the inside. The length of vibration of the tongue can be shortened by moving the dax across it.  Bow location and pressure allow for many dimensions of control.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should consider building your own. It's not so hard. Feel free to get in touch with questions. Samuel Burt builds them for people who do not have the time to build their own.

      <div class="section-title"><a name="parts">Parts of a Daxophone</a></div>
      <div class="large-text">Body</div>
      The body of the daxophone fits three legs that hold it at an angle towards the player. It has a clamp on one side to hold on a tongue. A thin piece of wood is glued on top, hiding two piezo microphone elements that attach to the quarter-inch jack.
      <img src="images/body.png" />
      <br /><br />
      <div class="large-text">Legs</div>
      The legs of a traditional daxophone fit snugly into holes in the body. My new daxophone design uses a design that allows the legs to screw in. My daxophone legs termiate in rubber feet.
      <br /><br />
      <div class="large-text">Tongue</div>
      Each tongue is a unique work of art, with its own density, grain, and shape. Bowing the tongue in different locations will cause it to vibrate based on the length of the segment.
      <img src="images/tongues.jpg">
      <br /><br />
      <div class="large-text">Dax</div>
      The dax is a large teardrop-shaped piece of heavy wood. It is placed on the tongue, flat or at an angle, to change the length of the vibrating segment of the tongue. Moving it back and forth and rolling it allows for continuous changes in pitch, like an unfretted string instrument. The dax also has a fretted side. When rolled over the tongue, the frets act to change the vibration of the tongue in discrete steps acting more or less as notes in a scale.
      <img src="images/dax.png" />
      <br /><br />
      <div class="large-text">Optional</div>
      DI Box: for instances where a longer line is needed, a direct box can remove ground hum, converting the quarter-inch line to a balanced XLR cable.
      <br />
      <br />
      Volume Pedal: a volume pedal is useful not only to bring down the level when its too strong but to also silence the daxophone while swapping out tongues.
      <br />
      <br />
      Reverb Pedal: a nice, tastefully controlled reverberation pedal can give the daxophone a little more sustain.
      <br />
      <br />
      Compressor Pedal: a well-chosen compressor pedal can help control some of the strong spikes of direct signal that the daxophone can generate in some circumstances.
      <br />
      <br />
      Amplifier: a good keyboard amp or acoustic guitar amp will provide sufficient clarity for the daxophone. A powered PA speaker works, too.

        Samuel Burt has constructed 20+ daxophones, shipping globally. Keep in mind that each daxophone is a work of love, and wood is an unpredictable living material, so if you order a daxophone, be patient. It might take a month or two to complete. Half the price is due up front. Shipping is included to anywhere in the continental United States. Get in touch at <a href="mailto:composer.samuel.burt@gmail.com?subject=PurchasingDaxophone">composer.samuel.burt@gmail.com</a>.

      <p>
        Daxophones come with one fretted dax and three tongues chosen to provide a good pitch range, complementary sounds, contrasting wood colors, and distinct shapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each daxophone is customed designed to your preferences, and the instrument continues to evolve, taking on new shapes. Email for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest models start at $500 and clamp right onto a desk or table. More elaborate custom models range from $1200-1500. Want to choose the color of the wood involved? Want to mount the daxophone to something else? Get in touch, today.

      <div class="large-text">Unfinished Kit</div>
       <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=DTTxifD48vek1PtOIqXh-ipBYgBb7L3R_y6XnEyDk3XP_tYpDbDKeI-ffcUMrErkdKuy0W&country.x=US&locale.x=US">Buy | $650</a>
       <br />
       The Unfinished Kit includes a finished dax, 3 tongues, and legs. I make all the precision cuts on the body and clamp, but it is unfinished. You get to know your instrument as you sand, solder, assemble, and stain the body.

        <br />
        The Complete Kit includes a finished daxophone body, sanded and stained. You get a dax, 3 tongues, and legs. You do the easy final stage of checking the soldering and glueing the top on yourself. Air mail has caused some parts to come loose during shipping, so its better for you to do one final test before the top goes on.

        <div class="large-text">Fretted Dax</div>
         <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=DTTxifD48vek1PtOIqXh-ipBYgBb7L3R_y6XnEyDk3XP_tYpDbDKeI-ffcUMrErkdKuy0W&country.x=US&locale.x=US">Buy | $150</a>
         <br />
         Some guitarists have requested just a dax to use on their instrument. You get a heavy, polished, fretted dax. I make mine from Argentine Lingum Vitae, one of the densest woods on the planet, which also means it is rare and expensive.

         <div class="large-text">Tongue</div>
        <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=DTTxifD48vek1PtOIqXh-ipBYgBb7L3R_y6XnEyDk3XP_tYpDbDKeI-ffcUMrErkdKuy0W&country.x=US&locale.x=US">Buy | $60</a>
        <br />
          Add another tongue to your order or buy them for your instrument. Each tongue is a unique piece. There are families of shapes and woods that are somewhat predictable in their sounds, but density varies from tree to tree. For a single tongue, multiple tongues might be made and tested.
