        <p>
        Burt composes for orchestra, soloists, chamber musicians, and invented instruments and creates both fixed-media and live-controlled electroacoustic music. His music encompasses many styles, notation and free improvisation. His scores explore
        process while evoking playful free-sounding rhythms. His collaborations explore the frontiers of new sounds, in-the-moment composition, and musical textures that avoid the familiar idioms. His electronic music involves algorithms and live
        processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experimentalism led him to constructing instruments that require a fundamentally different performance practice: Hans Reichel’s daxophone, based on bowing wood. He has constructed 20+, shipping globally. He plays the daxophone regularly as
        an improviser and in his compositions.

            <div class="section-title"><a name="long_bio">Biography</a></div>
            <p>
              Burt learned to read music from piano lessons and congregational hymn books, immediately applying this knowledge to composition. With some choral experience and experiments with the trumpet, electric keyboard, and recorder, he entered middle school band on the bass clarinet.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a teenager with an Atari computer, he composed more elaborate music, attempting to uncover the principles of harmony through experimentation. Burt created short stop motion films and composed the sound tracks on the computer. He regularly met with friends to practice jazz and other forms of improvisation and experimentation. In his senior year of high school, he composed music for friends including a work for the concert band. He was encouraged by the West Hall High School band director Ernie Phillips who allowed him to work in Finale on his office computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the University of Georgia, Burt received disciplined conservatory-like training that emphasized excellence and academic rigor. While studying the principles of musical analysis, Burt moved on to emersing himself in the many approaches of 20th Century music composition. He found a like-minded composition teacher, Lewis Nielson, who directed him to a more refined craft while exposing him to the extremes of 20th Century music. Leonard Ball instructed him in the techniques of <em>musique concrète</em> tape editing, analog synthesis, and spatialization, exposing Burt to the world of electronic music. He also performed with the Renaissance ensemble and the Athens Community Orchestra.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Athens Georgia, he became acquainted with musicians who were into exploring extended techniques and improvisation. <a href="https://colinbragg.bandcamp.com/">Colin Bragg</a> and <a href="https://killick.bandcamp.com/">Killick</a> led music ensembles and experimental projects that broadened Burt's perspective on the possibilities of sound art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Burt then took a year to compose a piece for orchestra and teach music theory to children at the <a href="https://ugacms.uga.edu/">University of Georgia Community Music School</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2003, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland to study composition and computer music at the Peabody Institute. Overseen by composer Christopher Theofanidis he finished his first large-scale orchestral piece, Parametric Transmutations. Directed by Geoffrey Wright, he wrote some of his first computer music software. He won prizes for his work at Peabody. Burt helped start the first performances of the 24hc, a day-long event of composition, practice, and performance. The 24hc continued annually with other students after his graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Baltimore, Burt became acquainted with the <a href="http://highzero.org/">High Zero Festival</a> and the many organizers who were also active musicians. Many of these musicians did not have classical training. He learned about the traditions of free improvisation and instrument building. This scene taught him the importance of collective organization and the benefits of mutual support. He was invited to join the Red Room Collective that organized the festival and a weekly series of improvised music. He remains a board member of the High Zero Foundation, curating shows, performing, and touring.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduation, Samuel Burt and <a href="http://coryryancomposer.com/">Cory Kasprzyk</a> toured their music up the East Coast with a grant from Peabody. They and a number of other Peabody affiliated musicians ran a series of new music events called After Now, focusing on compositions written by people from Baltimore, including <a href="https://www.twocomposers.org/asha/about.php">Asha Shrinivasan</a>, <a href="https://www.twocomposers.org/andrew/events.php">Andrew Cole</a>, <a href="http://www.marklackey.net/">Mark Lackey</a>, and Sally Sarles.
            </p>
            <p>
              From 2005-2009, Burt taught electronic music and music theory at the Baltimore School for the Arts. From 2011-2018, he taught computer music and music history at Goucher College. He continues to lecture on electronic music at Johns Hopkins University and instructs students in composition and song-writing at Towson University.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2011, he got in touch with instrument builder Hans Reichel about the woodworking plans Reichel made available for the daxophone. Burt built his first daxophone and then began building them for other people. Burt has built more then 20 daxophones, developing his woodworking skills. He's written compositions for daxophone and performs with it in the band Coy Fish.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, his collaborations include Lisa Weiss who will perform compositions for piano and mobile device, the <a href="https://www.bergamotquartet.com/">Bergamot String Quartet</a>, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/coyfish">Coy Fish</a>, <a href="http://dfiction.com/">Daniel Fishkin</a> (another daxophone builder), and an ensemble with Eric Franklin and Shelly Purdy of two daxophones and percussion.
