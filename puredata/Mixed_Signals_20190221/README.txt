SOFTWARE

This software was designed in 2017 to be run on any computer, an iPhone, or an Android phone.

 It was updated in 2019.

UPDATES
This software has been updated since the creation of this document. The controls have been simplified and should start with near-optimal settings for performance. I have had trouble transferring the software onto iOS devices. I do not have a current iOS device to troubleshoot. Let me know if you get it working. Contact me about further updates to the software. composer.samuel.burt@gmail.com

RUNNING
- Mixed_Signals automatically starts in running mode.
- You can hit the MIC button to stop it from receiving input, then hit the MIC button again when you are ready to play.
- You can hear a demonstration by turning off the MIC and turning on the DEMO button. 
The initialize button will reset all parameters and turn on the MIC if it is off.
- There is an indicator light in the bottom left that shows when the software detects a note being played. If you feel like it isn’t sensitive enough, you can try turning up the input_level or turning down the recog_thresh (recognition threshold).
- There is an indicator light in the bottom right that shows when the output clips. You can use the output_level slider to modify the output level to prevent clipping.
- There are numbered buttons that show your progress through the score. They should automatically advance when certain notes are detected. You can also tap one of these to begin at a certain section of the score.



NOTES ABOUT PERFORMANCE
- The sonic material generated by your computer or mobile device is not designed to be synchronized to your rhythmic playing. You might choose to add some rubato, though, if the electronic part inspires you to speed up or slow down.
- A performance with the electronic part might work better slower than the indicated tempo to allow more of the generated sonic events to poke through. This might just mean holding long notes out a bit longer while continuing to skitter the shorter notes very quickly. For 3/8 sections of the score, be more rigorous in maintaining the tempo, because the polyrhythms should be obvious.
- When reaching the end of the piece, if the electronic accompaniment doesn’t end automatically, hit the MIC button and it will silence itself.
